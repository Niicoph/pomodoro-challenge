/commit sdlc_implementor feature {"number":3,"title":"Add audio and visual notifications when timer completes","body":"Implement notification system to alert users when a Pomodoro work session or break timer completes. This ensures users don't miss the end of a cycle and can smoothly transition between work and breaks.\n\n  ## Functional Requirements\n\n  ### Audio Notifications\n  - Play a sound when work session completes (25 minutes)\n  - Play a sound when short break completes (5 minutes)\n  - Play a sound when long break completes (15 minutes)\n\n  ### Visual Notifications\n  - Display an on-screen alert/banner when timer reaches 00:00\n  - Alert shows which cycle just completed (e.g., \"Work session complete! Time for a break\")\n  - Alert includes a dismiss button\n  - Auto-dismiss after 5-10 seconds (optional)\n\n  ### Browser Notifications\n  - Request notification permission from user\n  - Send browser notification when timer completes (when tab is not focused)\n  - Notification shows cycle type and next suggested action\n\n  ### Settings/Controls\n  - Toggle to enable/disable audio notifications\n  - Toggle to enable/disable browser notifications\n  - Settings persist in localStorage\n  - Settings UI (could be a simple checkbox or a settings button)\n\n  ## UI/UX Considerations\n  - Non-intrusive notification UI that doesn't block the timer\n  - Clear visual feedback when notifications are muted\n  - Smooth fade-in/fade-out animations for alerts\n  - Accessible: ensure notifications work with screen readers\n  - Mobile-friendly: ensure audio works on mobile devices\n"}
