Time for a break.\"`)\n    77→  - `NEXT_CYCLE_SUGGESTIONS`: Record mapping each `CycleType` to a suggestion string (e.g., `work` → `\"Start your short break\"`)\n    78→\n    79→### Step 3: Create audio utility\n    80→- Create `src/utils/audio.ts` with a function `playNotificationSound(cycleType: CycleType): void`.\n    81→- Use the Web Audio API (`AudioContext`) to synthesize a short chime:\n    82→  - Work completion: two ascending tones (e.g., C5 → E5), indicating \"done, relax\".\n    83→  - Short break completion: two tones (e.g., E5 → G5), indicating \"back to work\".\n    84→  - Long break completion: three ascending tones (e.g., C5 → E5 → G5), indicating \"refreshed, start again\".\n    85→- Each tone should be ~150ms with a short gap between tones.\n    86→- Handle `AudioContext` initialization gracefully (browsers require user interaction before audio can play — the start button click satisfies this).\n    87→\n    88→### Step 4: Create the useNotifications hook\n    89→- Create `src/hooks/useNotifications.ts`.\n    90→- The hook should:\n    91→  - Load `NotificationSettings` from localStorage on mount (default: `{ audioEnabled: true, browserEnabled: false }`).\n    92→  - Expose `settings` and `updateSettings(partial: Partial<NotificationSettings>)` for the settings UI.\n    93→  - Expose `notificationState: NotificationState` for the visual banner.\n    94→  - Expose `triggerNotification(cycleType: CycleType): void` that:\n    95→    1.

When enabling, call `onRequestPermission()` first; if denied, keep the toggle off and show a brief message.\n   127→- Style with glassmorphism (`bg-white/20 backdrop-blur`) to match existing UI.\n   128→- Position the settings button in the top-right corner of the screen (fixed or absolute within the PomodoroTimer container).\n   129→\n   130→### Step 8: Add Tailwind animation keyframes\n   131→- In `tailwind.config.js`, extend the `animation` and `keyframes` objects:\n   132→  - `notification-enter`: slide down + fade in (translateY from -100% to 0, opacity 0 to 1, 300ms ease-out).\n   133→  - `notification-exit`: slide up + fade out (translateY from 0 to -100%, opacity 1 to 0, 300ms ease-in).\n   134→\n   135→### Step 9: Integrate everything in PomodoroTimer\n   136→- Update `src/components/PomodoroTimer.tsx`:\n   137→  - Import and call `useNotifications()`.\n   138→  - Pass `triggerNotification` as the `onComplete` callback to `useTimer`.\n   139→  - Render `<NotificationBanner>` with state from `useNotifications`.\n   140→  - Render `<NotificationSettings>` with settings and handlers from `useNotifications`.\n   141→  - Ensure the settings button and notification banner are positioned correctly and don't block the timer display.\n   142→\n   143→### Step 10: Run validation commands\n   144→- Run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation and build with zero errors.\n   145→- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.\n   146→- Manually test in browser at http://localhost:5173:\n   147→  - Start a timer (use short durations for testing by temporarily modifying `CYCLE_DURATIONS`).\n   148→  - Verify visual banner appears on completion.\n   149→  - Verify audio plays on completion.\n   150→  - Verify dismiss button works.\n   151→  - Verify auto-dismiss after 5 seconds.\n   152→  - Verify settings toggles work and persist on page reload.\n   153→  - Verify browser notification appears when tab is not focused.\n   154→  - Revert any temporary duration changes.\n   155→\n   156→## Testing Strategy\n   157→### Unit Tests\n   158→- **`useNotifications` hook**: Verify settings load from localStorage, `triggerNotification` sets correct state, `dismissNotification` clears state, settings persistence on update, auto-dismiss timer fires after 5 seconds.\n   159→- **`playNotificationSound`**: Verify the function does not throw and creates an AudioContext (mock the Web Audio API).\n   160→- **`NotificationBanner` component**: Verify it renders the correct message for each cycle type, shows/hides based on `isVisible`, calls `onDismiss` on button click.\n   161→- **`NotificationSettings` component**: Verify toggles reflect current settings, toggling calls `onUpdateSettings`, enabling browser notifications calls `onRequestPermission`.\n   162→\n   163→### Edge Cases\n   164→- Timer reaches 0 while audio is already playing (should not stack or crash).\n   165→- User denies browser notification permission — toggle should revert to off, no errors thrown.\n   166→- User rapidly toggles settings — localStorage should remain consistent.\n   167→- Browser does not support Notification API (older browsers) — degrade gracefully, hide browser notification toggle.\n   168→- AudioContext is suspended (not yet activated by user interaction) — handle the `resume()` promise.\n   169→- Multiple timer completions in quick succession (user resets and completes rapidly) — banner should update message, not stack multiple banners.\n   170→- Settings are corrupted in localStorage — fall back to defaults.\n   171→- Tab is focused when browser notification fires — should not show browser notification (only visual banner).\n   172→\n   173→## Acceptance Criteria\n   174→1. When any timer (work, short break, long break) reaches 00:00, a visual notification banner appears at the top of the screen.\n   175→2. The banner displays a message specific to the completed cycle (e.g., \"Work session complete! Time for a break.\").\n   176→3. The banner includes a dismiss button that removes it immediately when clicked.\n   177→4. The banner auto-dismisses after 5 seconds if not manually dismissed.\n   178→5. The banner has smooth fade-in and fade-out animations.\n   179→6. When audio notifications are enabled, a chime sound plays when the timer completes.\n   180→7. Different cycle types produce distinct notification sounds.\n   181→8. When browser notifications are enabled and the tab is not focused, a system notification is sent.\n   182→9. The browser notification displays the cycle type and a suggested next action.\n   183→10. A settings panel is accessible via a gear icon in the UI.\n   184→11. The settings panel contains toggles for audio notifications and browser notifications.\n   185→12. Enabling browser notifications triggers a permission request if not already granted.\n   186→13. All notification settings persist in localStorage across page reloads.\n   187→14. The notification banner is accessible (screen reader compatible with `role=\"alert\"`).\n   188→15. The notification UI does not block or obstruct the timer display.\n   189→16. The feature compiles with zero TypeScript errors (`npm run build` succeeds).\n   190→17. The feature works on mobile devices (responsive layout, audio plays on mobile browsers).\n   191→\n   192→## Validation Commands\n   193→Execute every command to validate the feature works correctly with zero regressions.\n   194→\n   195→- `npm run build` — Run build to validate the feature compiles with zero TypeScript errors and zero build errors.\n   196→- `npm run lint` — Run linting to validate code quality and style compliance.\n   197→- `npm run format:check` — Run Prettier format check to ensure consistent code formatting.\n   198→- `npm run dev` — Start development server and manually test the feature in browser at http://localhost:5173.\n   199→- Manually verify in browser:\n   200→  - Timer completion triggers visual banner with correct message.\n   201→  - Dismiss button works immediately.\n   202→  - Auto-dismiss works after ~5 seconds.\n   203→  - Audio plays on timer completion (when enabled).\n   204→  - Settings gear icon opens/closes settings panel.\n   205→  - Audio toggle enables/disables sound.\n   206→  - Browser notification toggle requests permission and sends notification when tab is unfocused.\n   207→  - Settings persist after page reload.\n   208→  - All existing timer functionality (start, pause, reset, cycle switching) still works correctly.\n   209→\n   210→## Notes\n   211→- **No new npm dependencies required.** The Web Audio API and Notification API are native browser APIs. Notification sounds are synthesized programmatically, eliminating the need for audio files.\n   212→- **Web Audio API approach**: Synthesizing sounds avoids the need to bundle audio files, keeps the project lightweight, and allows different tones per cycle type. The `AudioContext` requires user interaction before it can play — clicking the Start button satisfies this browser requirement.\n   213→- **Browser notification permission**: The permission request is triggered only when the user explicitly enables the browser notification toggle, not on page load. This respects user agency and avoids the common anti-pattern of requesting permissions on first visit.\n   214→- **Future extensibility**: The `NotificationSettings` type and `useNotifications` hook are designed to be easily extended with additional settings (e.g., volume control, custom sounds) in future iterations.\n   215→- **Mobile considerations**: The Web Audio API works on modern mobile browsers. Browser notifications may have limited support on iOS Safari — the feature degrades gracefully by hiding the toggle when the Notification API is not available.\n   216→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"9a2ea1f9-8643-40f5-9999-2f9a75b9ceff","uuid":"2ab0c6eb-cadc-4a5e-847e-d0807ce484b2","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"C:\\Users\\Nicolás\\Desktop\\tac\\pomodoro-challenge\\specs\\issue-3-adw-7c425707-sdlc_planner-audio-visual-notifications.md","content":"# Feature: Audio and Visual Notifications When Timer Completes\n\n## Metadata\nissue_number: `3`\nadw_id: `7c425707`\nissue_json: ``\n\n## Feature Description\nImplement a comprehensive notification system that alerts users when a Pomodoro work session or break timer completes.

Time for a break.\"`)\n  - `NEXT_CYCLE_SUGGESTIONS`: Record mapping each `CycleType` to a suggestion string (e.g., `work` → `\"Start your short break\"`)\n\n### Step 3: Create audio utility\n- Create `src/utils/audio.ts` with a function `playNotificationSound(cycleType: CycleType): void`.\n- Use the Web Audio API (`AudioContext`) to synthesize a short chime:\n  - Work completion: two ascending tones (e.g., C5 → E5), indicating \"done, relax\".\n  - Short break completion: two tones (e.g., E5 → G5), indicating \"back to work\".\n  - Long break completion: three ascending tones (e.g., C5 → E5 → G5), indicating \"refreshed, start again\".\n- Each tone should be ~150ms with a short gap between tones.\n- Handle `AudioContext` initialization gracefully (browsers require user interaction before audio can play — the start button click satisfies this).\n\n### Step 4: Create the useNotifications hook\n- Create `src/hooks/useNotifications.ts`.\n- The hook should:\n  - Load `NotificationSettings` from localStorage on mount (default: `{ audioEnabled: true, browserEnabled: false }`).\n  - Expose `settings` and `updateSettings(partial: Partial<NotificationSettings>)` for the settings UI.\n  - Expose `notificationState: NotificationState` for the visual banner.\n  - Expose `triggerNotification(cycleType: CycleType): void` that:\n    1. Sets `notificationState` to visible with the appropriate message.\n    2. Plays the audio sound if `audioEnabled` is true.\n    3. Sends a browser notification if `browserEnabled` is true and the tab is not focused (`!document.hasFocus()`).\n    4. Sets a 5-second auto-dismiss timer.\n  - Expose `dismissNotification(): void` to manually hide the banner.\n  - Expose `requestBrowserPermission(): Promise<boolean>` to request notification permission when the user enables browser notifications.\n  - Persist settings to localStorage whenever they change.\n\n### Step 5: Modify useTimer to support completion callback\n- In `src/hooks/useTimer.ts`, add an `onComplete` callback parameter to the hook:\n  - Change the signature to `useTimer(onComplete?: (cycleType: CycleType) => void)`.\n  - In the `useEffect` that manages the countdown, when `prev <= 1` (timer reaches 0), call `onComplete?.(currentCycle)` in addition to stopping the timer.\n  - Use a `useRef` for the callback to avoid stale closures and unnecessary re-renders.\n\n### Step 6: Create the NotificationBanner component\n- Create `src/components/NotificationBanner.tsx`.\n- Props: `message: string`, `cycleType: CycleType`, `isVisible: boolean`, `onDismiss: () => void`.\n- Render a fixed-position banner at the top of the screen (or overlaid on top of the timer).\n- Style with Tailwind: rounded corners, semi-transparent background matching the cycle color, white text, shadow.\n- Include a dismiss button (X icon) on the right side.\n- Use Tailwind transition classes for smooth fade-in (opacity-0 → opacity-100, translate-y) when `isVisible` is true.\n- When `isVisible` is false, render nothing (or use opacity-0 + pointer-events-none for animation).\n- Show the completion message and the next cycle suggestion.\n- Add `role=\"alert\"` and `aria-live=\"polite\"` for screen reader accessibility.\n\n### Step 7: Create the NotificationSettings component\n- Create `src/components/NotificationSettings.tsx`.\n- Props: `settings: NotificationSettings`, `onUpdateSettings: (settings: Partial<NotificationSettings>) => void`, `onRequestPermission: () => Promise<boolean>`.\n- Render a gear icon button that opens/closes a dropdown panel.\n- Inside the panel, show two toggle rows:\n  - \"Sound notifications\" with an on/off toggle (styled as a Tailwind switch).\n  - \"Browser notifications\" with an on/off toggle. When enabling, call `onRequestPermission()` first; if denied, keep the toggle off and show a brief message.\n- Style with glassmorphism (`bg-white/20 backdrop-blur`) to match existing UI.\n- Position the settings button in the top-right corner of the screen (fixed or absolute within the PomodoroTimer container).\n\n### Step 8: Add Tailwind animation keyframes\n- In `tailwind.config.js`, extend the `animation` and `keyframes` objects:\n  - `notification-enter`: slide down + fade in (translateY from -100% to 0, opacity 0 to 1, 300ms ease-out).\n  - `notification-exit`: slide up + fade out (translateY from 0 to -100%, opacity 1 to 0, 300ms ease-in).\n\n### Step 9: Integrate everything in PomodoroTimer\n- Update `src/components/PomodoroTimer.tsx`:\n  - Import and call `useNotifications()`.\n  - Pass `triggerNotification` as the `onComplete` callback to `useTimer`.\n  - Render `<NotificationBanner>` with state from `useNotifications`.\n  - Render `<NotificationSettings>` with settings and handlers from `useNotifications`.\n  - Ensure the settings button and notification banner are positioned correctly and don't block the timer display.\n\n### Step 10: Run validation commands\n- Run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation and build with zero errors.\n- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.\n- Manually test in browser at http://localhost:5173:\n  - Start a timer (use short durations for testing by temporarily modifying `CYCLE_DURATIONS`).\n  - Verify visual banner appears on completion.\n  - Verify audio plays on completion.\n  - Verify dismiss button works.\n  - Verify auto-dismiss after 5 seconds.\n  - Verify settings toggles work and persist on page reload.\n  - Verify browser notification appears when tab is not focused.\n  - Revert any temporary duration changes.\n\n## Testing Strategy\n### Unit Tests\n- **`useNotifications` hook**: Verify settings load from localStorage, `triggerNotification` sets correct state, `dismissNotification` clears state, settings persistence on update, auto-dismiss timer fires after 5 seconds.\n- **`playNotificationSound`**: Verify the function does not throw and creates an AudioContext (mock the Web Audio API).\n- **`NotificationBanner` component**: Verify it renders the correct message for each cycle type, shows/hides based on `isVisible`, calls `onDismiss` on button click.\n- **`NotificationSettings` component**: Verify toggles reflect current settings, toggling calls `onUpdateSettings`, enabling browser notifications calls `onRequestPermission`.\n\n### Edge Cases\n- Timer reaches 0 while audio is already playing (should not stack or crash).\n- User denies browser notification permission — toggle should revert to off, no errors thrown.\n- User rapidly toggles settings — localStorage should remain consistent.\n- Browser does not support Notification API (older browsers) — degrade gracefully, hide browser notification toggle.\n- AudioContext is suspended (not yet activated by user interaction) — handle the `resume()` promise.\n- Multiple timer completions in quick succession (user resets and completes rapidly) — banner should update message, not stack multiple banners.\n- Settings are corrupted in localStorage — fall back to defaults.\n- Tab is focused when browser notification fires — should not show browser notification (only visual banner).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. When any timer (work, short break, long break) reaches 00:00, a visual notification banner appears at the top of the screen.\n2. The banner displays a message specific to the completed cycle (e.g., \"Work session complete! Time for a break.\").\n3. The banner includes a dismiss button that removes it immediately when clicked.\n4. The banner auto-dismisses after 5 seconds if not manually dismissed.\n5. The banner has smooth fade-in and fade-out animations.\n6. When audio notifications are enabled, a chime sound plays when the timer completes.\n7. Different cycle types produce distinct notification sounds.\n8. When browser notifications are enabled and the tab is not focused, a system notification is sent.\n9. The browser notification displays the cycle type and a suggested next action.\n10. A settings panel is accessible via a gear icon in the UI.\n11. The settings panel contains toggles for audio notifications and browser notifications.\n12. Enabling browser notifications triggers a permission request if not already granted.\n13. All notification settings persist in localStorage across page reloads.\n14. The notification banner is accessible (screen reader compatible with `role=\"alert\"`).\n15. The notification UI does not block or obstruct the timer display.\n16. The feature compiles with zero TypeScript errors (`npm run build` succeeds).\n17. The feature works on mobile devices (responsive layout, audio plays on mobile browsers).\n\n## Validation Commands\nExecute every command to validate the feature works correctly with zero regressions.\n\n- `npm run build` — Run build to validate the feature compiles with zero TypeScript errors and zero build errors.\n- `npm run lint` — Run linting to validate code quality and style compliance.\n- `npm run format:check` — Run Prettier format check to ensure consistent code formatting.\n- `npm run dev` — Start development server and manually test the feature in browser at http://localhost:5173.\n- Manually verify in browser:\n  - Timer completion triggers visual banner with correct message.\n  - Dismiss button works immediately.\n  - Auto-dismiss works after ~5 seconds.\n  - Audio plays on timer completion (when enabled).\n  - Settings gear icon opens/closes settings panel.\n  - Audio toggle enables/disables sound.\n  - Browser notification toggle requests permission and sends notification when tab is unfocused.\n  - Settings persist after page reload.\n  - All existing timer functionality (start, pause, reset, cycle switching) still works correctly.\n\n## Notes\n- **No new npm dependencies required.** The Web Audio API and Notification API are native browser APIs. Notification sounds are synthesized programmatically, eliminating the need for audio files.\n- **Web Audio API approach**: Synthesizing sounds avoids the need to bundle audio files, keeps the project lightweight, and allows different tones per cycle type. The `AudioContext` requires user interaction before it can play — clicking the Start button satisfies this browser requirement.\n- **Browser notification permission**: The permission request is triggered only when the user explicitly enables the browser notification toggle, not on page load. This respects user agency and avoids the common anti-pattern of requesting permissions on first visit.\n- **Future extensibility**: The `NotificationSettings` type and `useNotifications` hook are designed to be easily extended with additional settings (e.g., volume control, custom sounds) in future iterations.\n- **Mobile considerations**: The Web Audio API works on modern mobile browsers. Browser notifications may have limited support on iOS Safari — the feature degrades gracefully by hiding the toggle when the Notification API is not available.\n","numLines":216,"startLine":1,"totalLines":216}}}
