/commit sdlc_planner feature {"number":7,"title":"Theme Customization","body":"### Summary\n\nImplement a visual theme system that allows the app to support multiple predefined color styles. Themes should only affect appearance (colors, backgrounds, accents, borders, etc.) and must not alter layout, spacing, or functionality.\n\nThe implementation should include several ready-to-use themes created as part of this task.\n\n---\n\n### Requirements\n\n* Create a theme system based on design tokens / variables (CSS variables, theme provider, or equivalent)\n\n* Implement **at least 3 predefined themes**, for example:\n\n  * Default Dark (current style)\n  * Light Theme\n  * Alternative Accent Theme (e.g., purple, blue, or green variant)\n\n* Themes must control:\n\n  * Background colors\n  * Text colors\n  * Accent / primary colors\n  * Card and surface colors\n  * Borders and separators\n  * Chart colors\n\n* Theme changes must apply globally across the UI\n\n* Themes should be structured so new ones can be added easily later\n\n---\n\n### Notes for Implementation\n\n* Focus on colors and visual styling only (no layout changes)\n* Prefer semantic tokens (e.g., `--color-bg-primary`, `--color-accent`)\n* Avoid direct color usage inside components\n* Ensure sufficient contrast for readability\n* Structure themes as objects/files so additional themes can be added easily later\n\n---\n"}
